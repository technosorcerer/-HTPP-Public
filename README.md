# HTPP - REPACKED

Patches here are found from all sources on the web. All archives will be in tzip format, and contain as much information as possible. The naming structure will be closely related to that of the No-Intro project.<br>

HACKS NAMES: Parent - Hack (Region) (Rev) (Author) (Patch Version)<br>
TRANS NAMES: Parent (Region) (Rev) (Language) (Author) (Patch Version)<br>

in the event that a patch does not contain a proper version number, a date format will be substituted based on the author's readme.<br>
https://datomatic.no-intro.org/stuff/The%20Official%20No-Intro%20Convention%20(20071030).pdf<br>
 
Translated languages will follow the "ISO 639 Language Codes Set 1" whenever possible.<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes<br>

European Portuguese will be listed as PT<br>
Brazilian Portuguese will be listed as PTBR<br>

***NOTE - FOR THE TIME BEING REPRODUCTION FILES SHOULD NOT GO IN THIS DATABASE***

A reproduction file would be one that was reverse-engineered from a prepatched rom to extract the patch.
For now, we would like those in a separate archive, contact Technosorcerer or Earthsouls to add those.
