File Formats

Maybe-Intro uses the same file formats as No-Intro or Redump whenever it is possible.

The ROM images do not have a header, unless it is essential.

The Nintendo Famicom/NES is the only system whose ROM images require the extra information from a header to be played and emulated. The games are stored in iNES format. An iNES file consists of a set of ROMs with a header which defines which types of ROMs the game is composed of and what mapper is used to control them.

Headers are obsolete for the other systems : NEC PC Engine, Nintendo Famicom Disk System, Nintendo Super Famicom/SNES. If a patch still requires a header to be applied, they are striped from the ROM files after the process.

The optical disc images use the following format :
- ISO+WAV with a CUE sheet for the NEC PC Engine CD-ROM² System and the Sega Mega-CD/Sega CD.
- BIN with a CUE sheet for the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation.
